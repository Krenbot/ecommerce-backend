## Description
Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

My motivation was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Technologies
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - to run the server in the terminal
* [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) - database management
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - to hide sensitive user data
* [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - data modeling/associations
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - seeing routed data

## Challenges
* Making sure all routes worked within Postman
* Using correct modeling and data types 
* Working with seeded data

## Future Implementation
* Better front-end implementation. Users could see CRUD operations on products in real time
* Additional product data

## User Story
```
